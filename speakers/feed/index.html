<p>Christina’s department works at the intersection of innovation practice, strategy, brand experience and cultural transformation on turning Swisscom into an experience-driven company.</p>
<p>Christina’s experience as a marketing and brand experience expert covers a wide range of assignments in the telecommunication industry (Swisscom, Omega/Switzerland, Mutiara Telecom/Kuala Lumpur). She worked in San Francisco for five years at Swisscom Outpost and brought back to Switzerland the knowledge she gained about Human Centered Design in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swisscom has been bringing Customer Experience practices in Switzerland over the last 15 years. The company has been experimenting methodologies like Scrum, User centered design, Lean UX and implemented it’s own flavor for each one. </span>We are thrilled to welcome Christina, since she has witnessed and led Swisscom evolution over the years. She will share her recipe to transform the company and explain the impact of those changes on Swisscom business.</p>

He is a speaker and thought leader on the future of product development and design, often teaching workshops or giving talks on building cultures that support teamwork and innovation.</p>
<p>He also co-founded Neo Innovation, a lean/agile product firm in NYC. Prior to that, he led the UX design teams at TheLadders and Web Trends. He also supervised and worked with small teams of software designers at AOL.</p>
<p>We started following Jeff from the moment on he said: Lean UX is the way to make Agile and UX work together. We strongly appreciate his approach, very simple and rational. Thanks to him, the UX &#8220;world&#8221; has moved forward with a giant step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Louise is a designer, thinker and maker who spends her time identifying patterns in human behaviour and making things to fit. She regularly speaks and writes about that theme. In addition, she is a published art historian, and has exhibited work at MoMA.</p>
<p>Louise has been involved in the creation of new financial services, rethinking broadcasting and health. She is now a government advisor on technology at Gov.uk, which is praised for its innovative approach to online public services.Gov.uk has very strong citizen-first approach, which inspires many other governments such as USA, Australia or Switzerland.</p>
<p>We are impressed by gov.uk work and Louise specific involvement in the enterprise. Following her story we are looking forward to hear what she has learned on the way, and how she brings new energy to this work.</p>
